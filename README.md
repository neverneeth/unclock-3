# Unclock üïë


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Redbone


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Navaneeth V. Sankar - College of Engineering, Trivandrum
- Member 2: Aithel Christo - College of Engineering, Trivandrum

### Project Description
Unclock is a versatile clock that performs functions that we can't exploit right now. It has a world clock, a stopwatch, a timer and an alarm all with a twist ;)

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The hegemony of standardized clock system. The matrix of SI units and fixed locations and linear shall be overcome.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
1. World Clock - Ever wanted time from another place but don't want to pick the place? We've got you covered. You just have to click Add Time. We'll pull random locations from around the world and give you the time.
2. Stopwatch - A standard stopwatch. Except the units aren't standard. The time is displayed in handpicked(AI Generated) units of time.
3. Timer - Runs just like any other timer. Except the real time weather from your locality slows or speeds it down. Rainy weather ensures slower clock speed while hotter weather makes it faster.
4. Alarm - Plays an alarm sound as loud as possible. We've abstracted away the time setting for you. It plays when you click the button.
